        "text": "The Starting Point of All AchievementThe First Step to Riches WHEN EDWIN C. BARNES climbed down from that freight train in Orange, N.J., he may have resembled a tramp, but histhoughtswere those of a king! As he made his way from the railroad tracks to Thomas Edison’s office, his mind was at work. He saw himselfstanding in Edison’s presence. He heard himself asking Mr. Edison for an opportunity to carry out the one CONSUMING OBSESSION OF HIS LIFE, a BURNING DESIRE to become the business associate of the great inventor. Barnes’ desire was not ahope! It was not awish! It was a keen, pulsating DESIRE that transcended everything else. It was DEFINITE. The desire was not new when he approached Edison. It had been Barnes’dominating desirefor a long time. In the beginning, when the desire first appeared in his mind, it may have been, probably was, only a wish, but it was no mere wish when he appeared before Edison with it. A few years later, Edwin C. Barnes again stood before Edison in the same office where he first met the inventor. This time his DESIRE had been translated into reality.He was in business with Edison. The dominating DREAM OF HIS LIFE had become a reality. People who later knew Barnes envied him because of the “break” that life had yielded him. They saw him in the days of his triumph, without taking the trouble to investigate thecauseof his success. Barnes succeeded because he chose a definite goal, placed all his energy, all his willpower, all his effort, everything back of that goal. He did not become the partner of Edison the day he arrived. He was content to start at the most menial work as long as it provided an opportunity to take even one step toward his cherished goal. Five years passed before the chance he had been seeking made its appearance. During all those years, not one ray of hope, not one promise of attainment of his DESIRE, had been held out to him. To everyone except himself, he appeared to be only another cog in the Edison business wheel, but in his own mind HE WAS THE PARTNER OF EDISON EVERY MINUTE OF THE TIME from the very day that he first went to work there. It is a remarkable illustration of the power of a DEFINITE DESIRE. Barnes won his goal because he wanted to be a business associate of Mr. Edison more than he wanted anything else. He created a plan by which to attain that purpose. But he BURNED ALL BRIDGES BEHIND HIM. He stood by his DESIRE until it became the dominating obsession of his life—and, finally, a fact. When he went to Orange, he did not say to himself, “I will try to induce Edison to give me a job of some sort.” He said, “I will see Edison and put him on notice that I have come to go into business with him.” He did not say, “I will work there for a few months and if I get no encouragement, I will quit and get a job somewhere else.” He did say, “I will start anywhere. I will do anything Edison tells me to do, butbefore I am through, I will be his associate.” He did not say, “I will keep my eyes open for another opportunity in case I fail to get what I want in the Edison organization.” He said, “There is but ONE thing in this world that I am determined to have, and that is a business association with Thomas A. Edison. I will burn all bridges behind me and stake my ENTIRE FUTURE on my ability to get what I want.” He left himself no possible way of retreat. He had to win or perish! That is all there is to the Barnes story of success! A long while ago, a great warrior faced a situation which made it necessary for him to make a decision which ensured his success on the battlefield. He was about to send his armies against a powerful foe whose men outnumbered his own. He loaded his soldiers into boats, sailed to the enemy’s country, unloaded soldiers and equipment, then gave the order to burn the ships that had carried them. Addressing his troops before the first battle, he said, “You see the boats going up in smoke. That means that we cannot leave these shores alive unless we win! We now have no choice.We win— or we perish!” They won. Those who would win in any undertaking must be willing to burn their ships and cut all sources of retreat. Only by so doing can one be sure of maintaining that state of mind known as a BURNING DESIRE TO WIN, essential to success. The morning after the great Chicago Fire, a group of merchants stood on State Street looking at the smoking remains of what had been their stores.1They went into a conference to decide if they would try to rebuild or leave Chicago and start over in a more promising section of the country. They reached a decision—all except one—to leave Chicago. The merchant who decided to stay and rebuild pointed a finger at the remains of his store and said, “Gentlemen, on that very spot I will build the world’s greatest store, no matter how many times it may burn down.” That was in 1871. The store was built. It became a towering monument to the power of that state of mind known as BURNING DESIRE. The easy thing for Marshal Field to have done would have been exactly what his fellow merchants did. When the going was hard and the future looked dismal, they pulled up and went where the going seemed easier.2 Mark well this difference between Marshal Field and the other merchants because it is the same difference that distinguished Edwin C. Barnes from thousands of other young people who worked in the Edison organization. It is the same difference which distinguishes practically all who succeed from those who fail. Every individual who reaches the age of understanding the purpose of money, wishes for it.Wishingwill not bring riches. Butdesiringriches with a state of mind that becomes an obsession, then planning definite ways and means to acquire riches, and backing those plans with persistencewhich does not recognize failure, will bring riches. The method by which DESIRE for riches can be transmuted into its financial equivalent consists of six definite, practical actions: First.Fix in your mind theexactamount of money you desire. It is not sufficient merely to say, “I want plenty of money.” Be definite as to the amount. (There is a psychological reason for definiteness which will be described in a subsequent chapter.) Second.Determine exactly what you intend to give in return for the money you desire. (There is no such reality as “something for nothing.”) Third.Establish a definite date when you intend topossessthe money you desire. Fourth.Create a definite plan for carrying out your desire, and beginat once, whether you are ready or not, to put this plan intoaction. Fifth.Write out a clear, concise statement of the amount of money you intend to acquire, name the time limit for its acquisition, state what you intend to give in return for the money, and describe clearly the plan through which you intend to accumulate it. Sixth.Read your written statement aloud, twice daily, once just before retiring at night and once after arising in the morning. AS YOU READ, SEE AND FEEL AND BELIEVE YOURSELF ALREADY IN POSSESSION OF THE MONEY. It is important that you follow the instructions described in these six actions. It is especially important that you observe and follow the instructions in the sixth. You may complain that it is impossible for you to “see yourself in possession of money” before you actually have it. Here is where a BURNING DESIRE will come to your aid. If you truly DESIRE money so keenly that your desire is an obsession, you will have no difficulty in convincing yourself that you will acquire it. The object is to want money and to become so determined to have it that you CONVINCE yourself youwillhave it. Only those who become “money-conscious” ever accumulate great riches. Money-consciousness means that the mind has become so thoroughly saturated with the DESIRE for money that one can see one’s self already in possession of it. To the uninitiated, who have not been schooled in the working principles of the human mind, these instructions may appear impractical. It may be helpful to all who fail to recognize the soundness of the six actions to know that the information they convey was received from Andrew Carnegie, who began as an ordinary laborer in the steel mills, but managed, despite his humble beginnings, to make these principles yield him a fortune of considerably more than one hundred million dollars.3It may be of further help to know that the six actions here recommended were carefully scrutinized by Thomas A. Edison, who placed his stamp of approval upon them as being not only the steps essential for the accumulation of money, but necessary for the attainment ofany definite goal. The steps call for no “hard labor.” They call for no “sacrifice.” They do not require one to become ridiculous or unthinking. To apply them calls for no great amount of education. But the successful completion of these six actions does call for sufficientimaginationto enable one to see, and to understand, that accumulation of money cannot be left to chance, good fortune, and luck. One must realize that all who have accumulated great fortunes first did a certain amount of dreaming, hoping, wishing, DESIRING, and PLANNINGbeforethey acquired money. You may as well know, right here, that you can never have riches in great quantities UNLESS you can work yourself into a white heat of DESIRE for money and actually BELIEVE you will possess it. You may as well know also that every great leader, from the dawn of civilization down to the present, was a dreamer. Christianity became one of the greatest powers in the world because its founder was an intense dreamer who had the vision and the imagination to see realities in their mental and spiritual form before they had been transmuted into physical form. If you do not see great riches in your imagination, you will never see them in your bank balance. Never in the history of America has there been so great an opportunity for practical dreamers as now exists. The hardships of these recent tough and unsettled economic times have put many people back at square one. A new race is about to be run. The stakes represent huge fortunes which will be accumulated within the next few years. The rules of the race have changed because we now live in a CHANGED WORLD that definitely favors those who have had little or no opportunity to win under the conditions existing recently, when fear often paralyzed personal and economic growth and development. We who are in this race for riches should be encouraged to know that this changed world in which we live is demanding new ideas, new ways of doing things, new leaders, new inventions, new methods of teaching, new methods of marketing, new books, new literature, new features for the mass media, new ideas for entertainment. Back of all this demand for new and better things there is one quality which one must possess to win, and that is DEFINITENESS OF PURPOSE—the knowledge of what one wants and a burning DESIRE to possess it. We have witnessed the death of one age and the birth of another. This changed world requires practical dreamers who canand willput their dreams into action. The practical dreamers have always been and always will be the pattern makers of civilization. We who desire to accumulate riches should remember that the real leaders of the world always have been individuals who harnessed and put into practical use the intangible, unseen forces of unborn opportunity, and converted those forces (or impulses of thought) into skyscrapers, cities, factories, airplanes, automobiles, and every form of convenience that makes life more pleasant. Tolerance and an open mind are practical necessities of the dreamer of today. Those who are afraid of new ideas are doomed before they start. Never has there been a time more favorable to pioneers than the present. True, there is no “Wild and Woolly West” to be conquered as in the days of the covered wagon. But there is a vast business, financial, and industrial world to be remolded and redirected along new and better lines. In planning to acquire your share of the riches, let no one influence you to scorn the dreamer. To win the big stakes in this changed world, you must catch the spirit of the great pioneers of the past whose dreams have given to civilization all that it has of value. It is that spirit which serves as the lifeblood of America—the burning desire to take full advantage of the wonderful opportunity, yours and mine, to develop and market our talents in a free land. Let us not forget, Columbus dreamed of an Unknown World, staked his life on the existence of such a world, and discovered it! Copernicus, the great astronomer, dreamed of a multiplicity of worlds and revealed them! No one denounced him as “impractical” after he had triumphed. Instead, the world worshiped at his shrine, thus proving once more that “SUCCESS REQUIRES NO APOLOGIES, FAILURE PERMITS NO ALIBIS.” If the thing you wish to do is right andyou believe in it, go ahead and do it! Put your dream across, and never mind what “they” say if you meet with temporary defeat, for “they” perhaps do not know that EVERY FAILURE BRINGS WITH IT THE SEED OF AN EQUIVALENT SUCCESS. Henry Ford, poor and uneducated, dreamed of a “horseless carriage,” went to work with what tools he possessed without waiting for opportunity to favor him, and now evidence of his dream belts the entire earth. He put more wheels into operation than anyone who ever lived—because he was not afraid to back his dreams. Thomas Edison dreamed of a lamp that could be operated by electricity, began where he stood to put his dream into action, and despite more than 10,000 failures, he stood by that dream until he made it a physical reality. Practical dreamers DO NOT QUIT!4 Lincoln dreamed of freedom for the slaves, put his dream into action, and barely missed living to see a united North and South translate his dream into reality. The Wright brothers dreamed of a machine that would fly through the air. Now one may see evidence all over the world that they dreamed soundly. Marconi dreamed of a system for harnessing the intangible forces of the electromagnetic spectrum.5Evidence that he did not dream in vain may be found in every radio and television set in the world. Moreover, Marconi’s dream brought the humblest cabin and the stateliest manor house side by side. It has made the people of every nation on earth back-door neighbors. It gave the President of the United States the means by which to talk to all the people of America at one time and on short notice. It may interest you to know that Marconi’s “friends” had him taken into custody and examined in a mental hospital when he announced he had discovered a principle through which he could send messages through the air, without the aid of wires or other direct physical means of communication. The dreamers of today fare better. The world has become accustomed to new discoveries. It has shown a willingness to reward the dreamer who gives the world a new idea. “The greatest achievement was at first and for a time a dream. The oak sleeps in the acorn; the bird waits in the egg; and in the highest vision of the soul a waking angel stirs. DREAMS ARE THE SEEDLINGS OF REALITIES.”6 Awake, arise, and assert yourself, you dreamers of the world. Your star is in the ascendancy. Worldwide economic uncertainty has brought the opportunity you have been waiting for. It has taught many people humility, tolerance, and open-mindedness. The world is filled with an abundance of OPPORTUNITY the dreamers of the past never knew. A BURNING DESIRE TO BE, AND TO DO, is the starting point from which the dreamer must take off. Dreams are not born of indifference, laziness, or lack of ambition. The world no longer scoffs at dreamers, nor calls them impractical. If you think it does, take a trip to Tennessee and visit the mighty dams and power plants of the Tennessee Valley Authority to witness what a “dreamer” President did in the way of harnessing and using the great water power of America. At one time, such a dream would have seemed like madness.7 You may have been disappointed, you may have suffered setbacks and defeat during hard economic times, you may have felt the great heart within you crushed until it bled. Take courage, for these experiences have tempered the spiritual metal of which you are made—they are assets of incomparable value. Remember, too, that all who succeed in life get off to a bad start and pass through many heartbreaking struggles before they “arrive.” The turning point in the lives of those who succeed usually comes at the moment of some crisis, through which they are introduced to their “other selves.” John Bunyan wrotePilgrim’s Progress, which is among the finest works in all of English literature, after he had been confined in prison and sorely punished because of his views on religion. O. Henry discovered the genius which slept within his brain after he had met with great misfortune and was confined in a prison cell, in Columbus, Ohio. Being FORCED, through misfortune, to become acquainted with his “other self” and to use his IMAGINATION, he discovered himself to be a great author, instead of a miserable criminal and outcast.8 Strange and varied are the ways of life, and stranger are the ways ofInfinite Intelligence,9through which human beings are sometimes forced to undergo all sorts of trouble and tribulation before discovering their own brains and their own capacity to create useful ideas through imagination. Edison, the world’s greatest inventor and scientist, started out as a “tramp” telegraph operator.10He failed innumerable times before he was driven finally to the discovery of the genius that slept within his brain. Charles Dickens began by pasting labels on blacking pots. The tragedy of his first love penetrated the depths of his soul and converted him into one of the world’s truly great authors. That tragedy produced, first,David Copperfield, then a succession of works that made this a richer and better world for all who read his books.11(Disappointment over love affairs can have the effect of driving many to drink and others to ruin—and this because most people never learn the art of transmuting their strongest emotions into dreams of a constructive nature. This power of “transmutation” will be dealt with in detail later.) Helen Keller became deaf and blind shortly after birth and for years could not speak. Despite her misfortune, she wrote her name indelibly in the pages of the history of the great. Her entire life served as evidencethat no one ever is defeated until defeat has been accepted as a reality. Robert Burns was an illiterate country lad who was cursed by poverty and who grew up to be a drunkard in the bargain. The world was made better for his having lived because he clothed beautiful thoughts in poetry and thereby plucked a thorn and planted a rose in its place. Booker T. Washington was born in slavery, handicapped by race and color in the society in which he lived. Because he was tolerant, had an open mind at all times and on all subjects, and was a DREAMER, he left his imprint for good on an entire nation. Beethoven was deaf, Milton was blind, but their names will last as long as civilization endures because they dreamed and translated their dreams into organized thought. Before passing to the next chapter, resolve yourself to kindle in your mind the fire of hope, faith, courage, and tolerance. Once you have these states of mind and a working knowledge of the principles described in this book, all else that you need will come to you—when you are READY for it.12 There is a difference between WISHING for a thing and being READY to receive it. You are neverreadyfor a thing until youbelieveyou can acquire it. The state of mind must be BELIEF, not mere hope or wish. Open-mindedness is essential for belief. Closed minds do not inspire faith, courage, and belief. Remember—no more effort is required to aim high in life, to demand abundance and prosperity, than is required to accept misery and poverty. Jessie B. Rittenhouse has correctly stated this universal truth through these lines in his poem “My Wage”: I bargained with Life for a penny,And Life would pay no more,However I begged at eveningWhen I counted my scanty store. For Life is a just employer,He gives you what you ask,But once you have set the wages,Why, you must bear the task. I worked for a menial’s hireOnly to learn, dismayed,That any wage I had asked of Life,Life would have willingly paid. As a fitting conclusion to this chapter, I wish to introduce one of the most unusual persons I have ever known. I first saw him many years ago, a few minutes after he was born. He came into the world without any external, physical sign of ears, and the doctor admitted, when pressed for an opinion, that the child would likely be deaf and mute for life.* *This was long before the advent of the kind of reconstructive surgery that is commonplace today. I challenged the doctor’s opinion. I had the right to do so. I was the child’s father. I, too, reached a decision and rendered an opinion, but I expressed the opinion silently, in the secrecy of my own heart. I decided that my son would hear and speak. Nature could send me a child without normal organs of hearing, but Nature could not induce me to accept the reality of the affliction. In my own mind, I knew that my son would hear and speak. How? I was sure there must be a way, and I knew I would find it. I thought of the words of the immortal Emerson: “The whole course of things goes to teach us faith. We need only obey. There is guidance for each of us, and by lowly listening, we shall hearthe right word.” The right word? DESIRE! More than anything else, I DESIRED that my son should not be deaf and mute. From that desire I never receded, not for a second. Many years previously I had written, “Our only limitations are those we set up in our own minds.” For the first time I wondered if that statement were true. Lying on the bed in front of me was a newborn child, without the natural equipment of hearing. Even though he might eventually hear and speak, he was obviously disfigured for life. Surely, this was a limitation which that child had not set up in his own mind. What could I do about it? Somehow, I would find a way to transplant into that child’s mind my own BURNING DESIRE for ways and means of conveying sound to his brain without the aid of ears. As soon as the child was old enough to cooperate, I would fill his mind so completely with a BURNING DESIRE to hear that Nature would, by methods of her own, translate that desire into physical reality. All this thinking took place in my own mind, but I spoke of it to no one. Every day I renewed the pledge I had made to myself not to accept this disability for my son. As he grew older and began to take notice of things around him, we observed that he had a slight degree of hearing. When he reached the age when children usually begin talking, he made no attempt to speak, but we could tell by his actions that he could hear certain sounds slightly. That was all I needed to know! I was convinced that if he could hear even slightly he might develop still greater hearing capacity. Then something happened which gave me hope. It came from an entirely unexpected source. We bought a Victrola, an old fashioned phonograph. When the child heard the music for the first time, he went into ecstasies and promptly appropriated the machine. He soon showed a preference for certain records, among them “It’s a Long Way to Tipperary.” On one occasion, he played that piece over and over for almost two hours, standing in front of the Victrolawith his teeth clamped on the edge of the case. The significance of this self-formed habit of his did not become clear to us until years afterward, for we had never heard of the principle of “bone conduction” of sound at that time. Shortly after he appropriated the Victrola, I discovered that he could hear me quite clearly when I spoke with my lips touching his mastoid bone, at his jawbone near where his ear canal would have been. These discoveries placed into my possession the necessary means by which I began to translate into reality my BURNING DESIRE to help my son develop hearing and speech. By that time he was making stabs at speaking certain words. The outlook was far from encouraging, but DESIRE BACKED BY FAITH knows no such word as impossible. Having determined that he could hear the sound of my voice plainly, I began immediately to transfer to his mind the desire to hear and speak. I soon discovered that the child enjoyed bedtime stories, so I went to work creating stories designed to develop in him self-reliance, imagination, and akeen desire to hear. There was one story in particular which I emphasized by giving it some new and dramatic coloring each time it was told. It was designed to plant in his mind the thought that his disability was not a liability, but an asset of great value. Despite the fact that all the philosophy I had examined clearly indicated that EVERY ADVERSITY BRINGS WITH IT THE SEED OF AN EQUIVALENT ADVANTAGE, I must confess that I had not the slightest ideahowthis affliction could ever become an asset. However, I continued my practice of wrapping that philosophy in bedtime stories, hoping the time would come when he would find some plan by which his disability could be made to serve some useful purpose. Reason told me plainly that there was no adequate compensation for the lack of ears and natural hearing equipment. DESIRE, backed by FAITH, pushed reason aside and inspired me to carry on. As I analyze the experience in retrospect, I can see now that my son’sfaith in mehad much to do with the astounding results. He did not question anything I told him. I sold him the idea that he had a distinctadvantageover his older brother and that this advantage would reflect itself in many ways.13 We could notice that the child’s hearing was gradually improving. Moreover, he had not the slightest tendency to be self-conscious because of his affliction. When he was about seven, he showed the first evidence that our method of servicing his mind was bearing fruit. For several months he begged for the privilege of selling newspapers, but his mother would not give her consent. She was afraid that his deafness made it unsafe for him to go out on the street alone. Finally, he took matters into his own hands. One afternoon when he was left at home with the servants, he climbed through the kitchen window, shinnied to the ground, and set out on his own. He borrowed six cents in capital from the neighborhood shoemaker, invested it in papers, sold out, reinvested, and kept repeating this process until late in the evening. After balancing his accounts and paying back the six cents he had borrowed from his “banker,” he had a net profit of 42 cents. When we got home that night, we found him in bed asleep with the money tightly clenched in his little hand. His mother opened his hand, removed the coins, and cried. Of all things! Crying over her son’s first victory seemed so inappropriate. My reaction was the reverse. I laughed heartily, for I knew that my endeavor to plant in the child’s mind an attitude of faith in himself had been successful. His mother saw in his first business venture a little deaf boy who had gone out in the streets and risked his life to earn money. I saw a brave, ambitious, self-reliant little businessman whose stock in himself had been increased a hundred percent because he had gone into business on his own initiative and had won. The transaction pleased me because I knew that he had given evidence of a trait of resourcefulness that would go with him all through life. Later events proved this to be true. When his older brother wanted something, he would lie down on the floor, kick his feet in the air, cry for it—and get it. When the “little deaf boy” wanted something, he would plan a way to earn the money, then buy it for himself. He would follow that pattern throughout adult life. Truly, my own son taught me that disabilities can be converted into steppingstones on which one may climb toward some worthy goal—unlessthey are accepted as obstacles and used as alibis. The little deaf boy went through grade school, high school, and college without being able to hear his teachers, except when they shouted loudly at close range. He did not go to a special school.14We were determined that he should live as normal a life as possible and associate with children with hearing, and we stood by that decision although it cost us many heated debates with school officials. While he was in high school, he tried a hearing aid, but it was of no value to him. During his last week in college, something happened which marked the most important turning point of his life. Through what seemed to be mere chance, he came into possession of another hearing aid device, which was sent to him on trial. He was slow about testing it because of his disappointment with the earlier device. Finally he picked the instrument up and more or less carelessly placed it on his head, hooked up the battery, and lo!—as if by a stroke of magic—his lifelong DESIRE FOR NORMAL HEARING BECAME A REALITY! For the first time in his life, he could hear practically as well as any person with normal hearing.15 Overjoyed because of the “Changed World” which had been brought to him through his hearing device, he rushed to the telephone, called his mother, and heard her voice perfectly. The next day he plainly heard the voices of his professors in class for the first time in his life! Previously he could hear them only when they shouted at short range. He heard the radio. He heard the movies. For the first time in his life he could converse freely with other people without the necessity of their having to speak loudly. Truly, he had come into possession of a Changed World. We had refused to accept Nature’s error, and, by PERSISTENT DESIRE, we had induced Nature to correct that error through the only practical means available. DESIRE had commenced to pay dividends, but the victory was not yet complete. The boy still had to find a definite and practical way to convert his disability into anequivalent asset. Hardly realizing the significance of what had already been accomplished, but intoxicated with the joy of his newly discovered world of sound, he wrote a letter to the manufacturer of the hearing aid, enthusiastically describing his experience. Something in his letter—something, perhaps, which was not writtenonthe lines, butbackof them—caused the company to invite him to New York. When he arrived, he was escorted through the factory and while talking with the chief engineer, telling him about his Changed World, a hunch, an idea, or an inspiration—call it what you wish—flashed into his mind. It was this impulse of thought which converted his affliction into an asset destined to pay dividends in both money and happiness to thousands of other people. The sum and substance of that impulse of thought was this: It occurred to him that he might be of help to the millions of deaf people who go through life without the benefit of hearing aids, if he could find a way to tell them the story of his Changed World. Then and there he reached a decision to devote the remainder of his life to rendering useful service to the hard of hearing. For an entire month he did intensive research during which he analyzed the entire marketing system of the manufacturer of the hearing device. He figured out possible ways and means to communicate with hearing-impaired people all over the world for the purpose of sharing with them his newly discovered “Changed World.” When this was done, he put in writing a two-year plan based upon his findings. When he presented the plan to the company, he was instantly given a position for the purpose of carrying out his ambition. Little did he dream when he went to work that he was destined to bring hope and practical relief to thousands of people who without his help would never have overcome their hearing disability. Shortly after he became associated with the manufacturer of his hearing aid, he invited me to attend a class conducted by his company to teach deaf people to hear and to speak. I had never heard of such a form of education; therefore, I visited the class, skeptical but hopeful that my time would not be entirely wasted. Here I saw a demonstration which gave me a greatly enlarged vision of what I had done to arouse and keep alive in my son’s mind the DESIRE for normal hearing. I saw deaf people actually being taught to hear and to speak through application of the self-same principle I had used more than 20 years previously with my son, Blair. There is no doubt in my mind that Blair would have been unable to hear or speak for all his life if his mother and I had not managed to shape his mind as we did. The doctor who attended at his birth told us the child might never hear a sound or say a word. Later, Dr. Irving Voorhees, a noted specialist on such cases, examined Blair thoroughly. He was astounded when he learned how well my son could hear and speak, and he said his examination indicated that “theoretically, the boy should not be able to hear at all.” When I planted in Blair’s mind the DESIRE to hear and talk and live normally, there went with that impulse some strange influence which caused Nature to become “bridge-builder” and to span the gulf of silence between his brain and the outer world— by some means which the keenest medical specialists were not able to interpret. It would be sacrilege for me even to pretend I fully understand how Nature performed this miracle. It would be unforgivable if I neglected to tell the world as much as I know of the humble part I assumed in the strange experience. It is my duty and a privilege to say I believe, and not without reason, thatnothing is impossible to the person who backs DESIRE with enduring FAITH. A BURNING DESIRE has devious ways of transmuting itself into its physical equivalent. Blair DESIRED normal hearing. And he received it! He was born with a disability which might easily have sent one with a less defined DESIRE to the street with a bundle of pencils and a tin cup. That disability served as the medium by which he would go on to render useful service to many thousands of hearing-impaired people, and it gave him useful employment at adequate financial compensation for years. The little “white lie” I planted in his mind when he was a child— by leading him to BELIEVE his affliction would become a great asset which he could capitalize on—justified itself. Verily, there is nothing, right or wrong, that BELIEF plus BURNING DESIRE cannot make real. These qualities are free to everyone. In all my experience in dealing with men and women with personal problems, I never handled a single case which more definitely demonstrated the power of DESIRE. Authors sometimes make the mistake of writing of subjects of which they have but superficial or very elementary knowledge. It has been my good fortune to have had the privilege of testing the soundness of the POWER OF DESIRE through the affliction of my own son. Perhaps it was providential that the experience came as it did, for surely no one was better prepared than he to serve as an example of what happens when DESIRE is put to the test.If Mother Nature bends to the will of a burning desire, is it logical to think that mere human beings can defeat one? Strange and imponderable is the power of the human mind! We do not understand the method by which it uses every circumstance, every individual, every physical thing within its reach as a means of transmuting DESIRE into its physical counterpart. Perhaps science will one day uncover this secret. I planted in my son’s mind the DESIRE to hear and to speak as any other person hears and speaks. That DESIRE became a reality. I planted in his mind the DESIRE to convert his greatest disability into his greatest asset. That DESIRE was realized. The method by which this astounding result was achieved is not hard to describe. It consisted of three very definite acts: First, I MIXED FAITH with the DESIRE for normal hearing, which I passed on to my son. Second, I communicated my desire to him in every conceivable way available through persistent, continuous effort, over a period of years. Third, HE BELIEVED ME! As this chapter was being completed, news came of the death of Mme. Schuman-Heink.16One short paragraph in the news dispatch about her death gives the clue to this unusual woman’s stupendous success as a singer. I quote portions of the paragraph because the clue it contains is none other than DESIRE. Early in her career, Mme. Schuman-Heink visited the director of the Vienna Court Opera to audition for him. But he did not grant the audition. After taking one look at the awkward and poorly dressed girl, he exclaimed, none too gently, “With such a face, and with no personality at all, how can you ever expect to succeed in opera? My good child, give up the idea. Buy a sewing machine, and go to work. YOU CAN NEVER BE A SINGER.” Never is a long time! The director of the Vienna Court Opera knew much about the technique of singing. He knew little about the power of desire when it assumes the proportion of an obsession. If he had known more about that power, he would not have made the mistake of condemning genius without giving it an opportunity. Several years ago, one of my business associates became seriously ill. He became worse as time went on and finally was taken to the hospital for surgery. Just before he was wheeled into the operating room, I took a look at him and wondered how anyone as thin and emaciated as he could possibly go through such a major operation successfully. The surgeon warned me that there was little if any chance of my ever seeing him alive again. But that was the DOCTOR’S OPINION. It was not the opinion of the patient. Just before he was wheeled away, he whispered feebly, “Do not be disturbed, Chief, I will be out of here in a few days.” The attending nurse looked at me with pity. But the patient did come through safely. After it was all over, his physician said, “Nothing but his own desire to live saved him. He never would have pulled through if he had not refused to accept the possibility of death.” I believe in the power of DESIRE backed by FAITH because I have seen this power lift people from lowly beginnings to places of power and wealth. I have seen it rob the grave of its victims. I have seen it serve as the medium by which individuals staged a comeback after having been defeated in a hundred different ways. I have seen it provide my own son with a normal, happy, successful life despite Nature’s having sent him into the world severely disabled. How can one harness and use the power of DESIRE? This question is answered through this and the subsequent chapters of this book. This message is going out to the world at the end of one of the most devastating economic upheavals America has ever known. It is reasonable to presume that the message may come to the attention of many who have been wounded by personal economic calamity, those who have lost their fortunes, others who have lost their positions, and great numbers who must reorganize their plans and stage a comeback. To all these, I wish to convey this thought: All achievement, no matter what may be its nature or its purpose, must begin with an intense, BURNING DESIRE for something definite. Through some strange and powerful principle of “mental chemistry” which she has never divulged, Nature wraps up in the impulse of STRONG DESIRE that “something” which recognizes no such word as “impossible” and accepts no such reality as failure. Fortunately, Nature has also given us the way to channel DESIRE unwaveringly toward the goals we name and seek. It is the way of FAITH—The Second Step to Riches. FAITH IS A STATE OF MIND WHICH MAY BE INDUCED BY AUTOSUGGESTION."

        "transcript": "在这一章里，我们深入了解了“信念”在实现欲望中的关键作用。信念就像是我们心中的“头号化学家”，它能把模糊的想法变成具体的行动和财富。当你把信念与思想的振动结合起来，潜意识会立即捕捉到这种振动，把它转化为精神上的等价物，然后传递给无限智慧，就像祈祷一样。而让这种振动“变色”的，是信念、爱和性这三种最强大的正面情感。当它们融合在一起时，就像打开了一条直通无限智慧的“直线”，让你的思想更快、更强烈地影响潜意识。\n\n你可能会问，信念到底怎么建立？其实，信念可以通过反复的自我暗示来培养。就像有人说，反复告诉自己“我能成功”，久而久之，潜意识就会相信你是真的有这个能力，然后行动起来，帮你实现目标。这个过程就像是“欺骗”你的潜意识，让它相信你已经拥有了你渴望的东西。你只需要每天坚持用积极的语句反复暗示自己，逐渐，信念就会在你心中生根发芽。\n\n但要注意，潜意识不会区分善恶，它会把你心中任何带有情感的想法变成现实。比如，很多人觉得自己“注定贫穷”，这其实是他们自己用负面信念“种”下的“恶果”。相反，如果你用信念、爱和热情去灌输积极的想法，潜意识也会帮你把这些变成现实。正如故事中提到的，信念的力量可以让一个普通人变成伟人，比如甘地用信念影响了数亿人，带来了巨大的变革。\n\n这章还强调，信念不仅仅是宗教或哲学的概念，它是科学可以验证的力量。你可以通过自我暗示，主动“灌输”信念，改变自己的命运。就像美国钢铁巨头的创始人，靠着坚定的信念和不懈的坚持，把一个想法变成了价值数百亿的帝国。这个故事告诉我们，财富和成功都源于思想的力量，只要你相信自己，持之以恒，梦想就能变成现实。\n\n所以，记住：信念是开启财富和成功的钥匙。用积极的思想和反复的自我暗示，激发潜意识的力量，让你的梦想逐步变成现实。只要你相信，任何看似遥不可及的目标，都能变成你手中的财富。",

        "text": "Visualization and Belief in the Attainment of DesireThe Second Step to Riches FAITH IS the head chemist of the mind. When FAITH is blended with the “vibration of thought,” the subconscious mind instantly picks up the vibration, translates it into its spiritual equivalent, and transmits it to Infinite Intelligence, as in the case of prayer.1 The emotions of FAITH, LOVE, and SEX are the most powerful of all the major positive emotions. When the three are blended, they have the effect of “coloring” the vibration of thought in such a way that it instantly reaches the subconscious mind, where it is changed into its spiritual equivalent—the only form that induces a response from Infinite Intelligence. Love and faith are psychic, related to the spiritual side of humanity. Sex is purely biological and related only to the physical. The mixing, or blending, of these three emotions has the effect of opening a direct line of communication between the finite, thinking human mind and Infinite Intelligence. There comes now a statement which will give a better understanding of the importance theprinciple of autosuggestionassumes in the transmutation of desire into its physical, or monetary, equivalent:FAITH is a state of mind which may be induced, or created,by affirmations or repeated instructions to the subconscious mind, through the principle of autosuggestion. As an illustration, consider one main purpose for which, presumably, you are reading this book. The object is, naturally, to acquire the ability to transmute the intangible thought impulse of DESIRE into its physical counterpart—money. By following the instructions laid down in the chapters on autosuggestion (Chapter 3) and the subconscious mind (Chapter 11), as summarized in the chapter on autosuggestion, you can CONVINCE your subconscious mind that youbelieveyou will receive that for which you ask. Your subconscious mind will act upon that belief, then pass it back to you in the form of FAITH, followed by definite plans for procuring that which you desire. The method by which one develops FAITH where it does not already exist is extremely difficult to describe, almost as difficult, in fact, as it would be to describe the color of red to a blind person who has never seen color and has nothing with which to compare what you describe. Faith is a state of mind which you can developat willafter you have mastered the 13 principles in this book—because it is a state of mind which develops through voluntary application and use of these principles. Repetition or affirmation of orders to your subconscious mind is the only method of voluntary development of the emotion of faith. Perhaps the meaning will be made clearer through the following explanation of how individuals sometimes become criminals. Stated in the words of a famous criminologist, “When people first come into contact with crime, they abhor it. If they remain in contact with crime for a time, they become accustomed to it and endure it. If they remain in contact with it long enough, they finally embrace it and become influenced by it.” This is the equivalent of saying that any impulse of thought which is repeatedly passed on to the subconscious mind is finally accepted and acted upon by the subconscious mind, which proceeds to translate that impulse into its physical equivalent, by the most practical procedure available. In connection with this, consider again the statement ALL THOUGHTS WHICH HAVE BEEN EMOTIONALIZED (given feeling) AND MIXED WITH FAITH begin immediately to translate themselves into their physical equivalent or counterpart. The emotions, or the “feeling” portion of thoughts, are the factors which give thoughts vitality, life, and action. The emotions of faith, love, and sex, when mixed together with any thought impulse, give it greater action than any of these emotions can do singly. It is not only those thought impulses which have been mixed with FAITH, but those which have been mixed with any of the positive emotions, or any of the negative emotions, that can reach and influence the subconscious mind. From this statement you will understand that the subconscious mind will translate into itsphysical equivalenta thought impulse of a negative or destructive nature just as readily as it will act upon thought impulses of a positive or constructive nature. This accounts for the strange phenomenon, which so many millions of people experience, referred to as “misfortune” or “bad luck.” There are millions of people who BELIEVE themselves “doomed” to poverty and failure because of some strange force over which they BELIEVE they have no control. They are the creators of their own misfortunes because of this negative BELIEF, which is picked up by their subconscious mind and translated into its physical equivalent. This is an appropriate place at which to suggest again thatyou may benefit, by passing on to your subconscious mind, any DESIRE which you wish translated into its physical or monetary equivalent, in a state of expectancy or BELIEF that the transmutation will actually take place. Your BELIEF, or FAITH, is the element which determines the action of your subconscious mind. There is nothing to hinder you from “deceiving” your subconscious mind when giving it instructions through autosuggestion, as I deceived my son’s subconscious mind. To make this “deceit” more realistic, conduct yourself when you call upon your subconscious mind just as you would if you were ALREADY IN POSSESSION OF THE MATERIAL THING WHICH YOU ARE DEMANDING. The subconscious mind will transmute into its physical equivalent, by the most direct and practical media available,anyorder which is given to it in a state of BELIEF, or FAITH, that the order will be carried out. Surely, enough has been stated by now to give you a starting point from which you may, through experiment and practice, acquire the ability to mix FAITH with any order given to your subconscious mind. Perfection will come through practice. It cannot come by merely reading instructions. If it be true that one may become a criminal by association with crime (and this is a known fact), it is equally true that one may develop faith by voluntarily suggesting to the subconscious mind that one has faith. The mind comes, finally, to take on the nature of the influences which dominate it. Understand this truth, and you will know why it is essential for you to encourage thepositive emotionsas dominating forces of your mind and to discourage—andeliminate—negative emotions.2 A mind dominated by positive emotions, or “positive mental attitude,” becomes a favorable abode for the state of mind known as faith. A mind so dominated may, at will, give the subconscious mind instructions which it will accept and act upon immediately. All down the ages, the religionists3have admonished struggling humanity to “have faith” in this, that, and the other dogma or creed, but they have failed to tell people HOW to have faith. They have not stated that “faith is a state of mind and that it may be induced by self-suggestion.” In language which any normal human being can understand, this book will describe all that is known about the principle through which FAITH can be developed where it does not already exist. Have faith in yourself; faith in the Infinite. Before we begin, you should be reminded again that: FAITH is the “eternal elixir” which gives life, power, and action to the impulse of thought! The foregoing sentence is worth reading a second time, and a third, and a fourth. It is worth reading aloud! FAITH is the starting point of all accumulation of riches! FAITH is the basis of all “miracles” and all mysteries which cannot be analyzed by the rules of science! FAITH is the only known antidote for FAILURE! FAITH is the element, the “chemical” which when mixed with prayer gives one direct communication with Infinite Intelligence. FAITH is the element which transforms the ordinary “vibration of thought,” created by the finite human mind, into its spiritual equivalent. FAITH is the only agency through which the cosmic force of Infinite Intelligence can be harnessed and used by humanity. EVERY ONE OF THE FOREGOING STATEMENTS IS CAPABLE OF PROOF! The proof is simple and easily demonstrated. It is wrapped up in the principle of autosuggestion. Let us center our attention, therefore, on the subject of self-suggestion and find out what it is and what it is capable of achieving. It is a well-known fact that one comes finally to BELIEVE whatever one repeats to one’s self,whether the statement be true or false. If we repeat a lie over and over, we will eventually accept the lie as truth. Moreover, we will BELIEVE it to be the truth. Each of us is what we are because of the DOMINATING THOUGHTS which we permit to occupy our mind. Thoughts which we deliberately place in our own mind, and encourage with sympathy, and with which we mix any one or more of the emotions, constitute the motivating forces which direct and control our every movement, act, and deed! Comes, now, a very significant statement of truth: THOUGHTS WHICH ARE MIXED WITH ANY OF THE FEELINGS OF EMOTIONS CONSTITUTE A “MAGNETIC” FORCE WHICH ATTRACTS OTHER SIMILAR, OR RELATED THOUGHTS. A thought thus “magnetized” with emotion may be compared to a seed which, when planted in fertile soil, germinates, grows, andmultiplies itself over and over again until that which was originally one small seed becomes countless millions of seeds of the SAME KIND! All human experience, and all human thinking, occurs in an environment—in auniverse—saturated with radiated energy and “signals.” From gravity to magnetism, from cosmic rays to X-rays, infrared rays, visible light, sound waves, radar, shortwaves, radio and television signals—we live in a world constantly bombarded by “vibrations” of energy, though we can perceive directly only the tiniest portion of them. Likewise, thought impulses are “vibrations” of energy transmitted in some deeply mysterious, and as yet uncomprehended, way as electrical and chemical currents among brain cells. While we do not yet understand and cannot describe scientifically the how of the process, it is clear that thought impulses, like electromagnetic radiation, also are “out there” somehow—as some experiments with extrasensory perception, or ESP, seem clearly to indicate. Human experience, like the cosmos itself, teems with thought vibrations or “influences”—both destructive and constructive. It is characterized, at all times, by vibrations of fear, poverty, disease, failure, misery, and vibrations of prosperity, health, success, and happiness—just as surely as the atmosphere carries the sound of hundreds of orchestrations of music, and hundreds of human voices, all of which maintain their own individuality, and means of identification, through the medium of television or radio. From this great “storehouse” of experience, the human mind is constantly attracting vibrations which harmonize with that which DOMINATES the mind. Any thought, idea, plan, or purpose which one holds in one’s mind attracts from the “thought vibrations of existence” a host of its relatives, adds these relatives to its own force, and grows until it becomes the dominating, MOTIVATING MASTER of the individual in whose mind it has been housed. Now, let us go back to the starting point and become informed as to how the original seed of an idea, plan, or purpose may be planted in the mind. The information is easily conveyed: Any idea, plan, or purpose may be placed in the mindthroughrepetition ofthought. This is why you are asked in the next few pages to write out a statement of your major purpose, or Definite Chief Aim, commit it to memory, and repeat itout loudday after day until these vibrations of sound have reached your subconscious mind. We are what we are because of the vibrations of thought which we pick up and register through the stimuli of our daily environment. Resolve to throw off the influences of any unfortunate environment you may have grown up in or now find yourself living in, and to build your own life to ORDER. Taking inventory of mental assets and abilities, you will discover that your greatest weakness is lack of self-confidence. This handicap can be surmounted, and timidity translated into courage, through the aid of the principle of autosuggestion. The application of this principle may be made through a simple arrangement of positive thought impulses stated in writing, memorized, and repeated until they become a part of the working equipment of your subconscious mind. First. I know that I have the ability to achieve the object of my Definite Purpose in life; therefore, I DEMAND of myself persistent, continuous action toward its attainment, and I here and now promise to render such action. Second. I realize that the dominating thoughts of my mind will eventually reproduce themselves in outward, physical action, and gradually transform themselves into physical reality; therefore, I will concentrate my thoughts for 30 minutes daily upon the task of thinking ofthe person I intend to become, thereby creating in my mind a clear mental picture of that person. Third. I know that through the principle of autosuggestion any desire that I persistently hold in my mind will eventually seek expression through some practical means of attaining the object back of it; therefore, I will devote ten minutes daily to demanding of myself the development of SELF-CONFIDENCE. Fourth. I have clearly written down a description of my DEFINITE CHIEF AIM in life, and I will never stop trying until I shall have developed sufficient self-confidence for its attainment.4 Fifth. I fully realize that no wealth or position can long endure unless built upon truth and justice; therefore, I will engage in no transaction that does not benefit all whom it affects. I will succeed by attracting to myself the forces I wish to use and the cooperation of other people. I will induce others to serve me because of my willingness to serve others. I will eliminate hatred, envy, jealousy, selfishness, and cynicism by developing love for all humanity—because I know that a negative attitude toward others can never bring me success. I will cause others to believe in me because I will believe in them and in myself. Sixth.I will sign my name to this formula, commit it to memory, and repeat it aloud once a day, with full FAITH that it will gradually influence my THOUGHTS and ACTIONS so that I will become a self-reliant and successful person. Back of this formula is a law of Nature which no one has yet been able to explain. It has baffled the scientists of all ages. The psychologists have named this the “Law of Autosuggestion” and let it go at that. The name by which one calls this law is of little importance. The important fact about it is—it WORKS for the glory and success of mankind, IF it is used constructively. On the other hand, if used destructively, it will destroy just as readily. In this statement may be found a very significant truth, namely, that those who go down in defeat and end their lives in poverty, misery, and distress do so because of negative application of the principle of autosuggestion. The cause may be found in the fact that ALL IMPULSES OF THOUGHT HAVE A TENDENCY TO CLOTHE THEMSELVES IN THEIR PHYSICAL EQUIVALENT. The subconscious mind (the “chemical laboratory” in which all thought impulses are combined and made ready for translationinto physical reality) makes no distinction between constructive and destructive thought impulses. It works with the material we feed it through our thought impulses. The subconscious mind will translate into reality a thought driven by FEAR just as readily as it will translate into reality a thought driven by COURAGE or FAITH. The pages of medical history are rich with illustrations of cases of “suggestive suicide.” A person may commit suicide through negative suggestion just as effectively as by any other means. In a Midwestern city, a man by the name of Joseph Grant, a bank official, “borrowed” a large sum of the bank’s money without the consent of the directors. He lost the money through gambling. One afternoon, the bank examiner came and began to check the accounts. Grant left the bank, took a room in a local hotel, and when they found him three days later, he was lying in bed, wailing and moaning, repeating over and over these words, “My God, this will kill me! I cannot stand the disgrace.” In a short time he was dead. The doctors pronounced the case one of “mental suicide.” Just as electricity turns the wheels of industry and renders useful service if used constructively, or can snuff out life if used improperly, so will the Law of Autosuggestion lead you to peace and prosperity or down into the valley of misery, failure, and death, according to your degree of understanding and application of it. If you fill your mind with FEAR, DOUBT, AND UNBELIEF in your ability to connect with and use the forces of Infinite Intelligence, then the Law of Autosuggestion will take this spirit of unbelief and use it as a pattern by which your subconscious mind will translate it into its physical equivalent. THIS STATEMENT IS AS TRUE AS THE STATEMENT THAT TWO AND TWO EQUALS FOUR! Like the wind which carries one ship East and another West, the Law of Autosuggestion will lift you up or pull you down, according to the way you set your sails of THOUGHT. The Law of Autosuggestion, through which any person may rise to altitudes of achievement which stagger the imagination, is well described in the following verse: If youthinkyou are beaten, you are,If youthinkyou dare not, you don’t.If you like to win, but youthinkyou can’t,It is almost certain you won’t.If youthinkyou’ll lose, you’re lost,For out of the world we find,Success begins with a fellow’s will --It’s all in thestate of mind.If youthinkyou are outclassed, you are,You’ve got tothinkhigh to rise,You’ve got to besure of yourselfbeforeYou can ever win a prize.Life’s battles don’t always goTo the stronger or faster man,But soon or late the man who winsIs the man WHO THINKS HE CAN! Observe the words which have been emphasized and you will catch the deep meaning the poet5had in mind. Somewhere in your makeup (perhaps in the cells of your brain) there lies sleeping the seed of achievement which, if aroused and put into action, would carry you to heights such as you may never have hoped to attain. Just as a master musician may cause the most beautiful strains of music to pour forth from the strings of a violin, so may you arouse the genius which lies asleep in your brain and cause it to drive you upward to whatever goal you may wish to achieve. Abraham Lincoln was a failure at everything he tried until he was well past the age of 40. He was a Mr. Nobody from Nowhere until a great experience came into his life, aroused the sleeping genius within his heart and brain, and gave the world one of its truly great men. That experience was mixed with the emotions ofsorrow and LOVE. It came to him through Anne Rutledge, the only woman he ever truly loved. It is a known fact that the emotion of LOVE is closely akin to the state of mind known as FAITH because love comes very near to translating one’s thought impulses into their spiritual equivalent. During my long years of research, I discovered from the analysis of the life work and achievements of hundreds of people of outstanding accomplishment that there was the influence of a spouse’s love back of nearly EVERY ONE OF THEM. If you wish evidence of the power of FAITH, study the achievements of men and women who have employed it. At the head of the list comes the Nazarene. Christianity is one of the greatest single forces ever to influence the minds of people. The basis of Christianity is FAITH, no matter how many people may have perverted or misinterpreted the meaning of this great force, and no matter how many dogmas and creeds have been created in its name which do not reflect its tenets. The sum and substance of the teachings and the achievements of Christ, which have been interpreted as miracles, were nothing more nor less than FAITH. If there are any such phenomena as miracles, they are produced only through the state of mind known as FAITH! Some teachers of religion and many who call themselves Christians neither understand nor practice FAITH. FAITH is the cornerstone of every great religion. The Old Testament psalmist has written, “O love the LORD, all ye his saints: for the LORD preserveth the FAITHFUL, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.” The apostle Luke tells us, “And Stephen, full of FAITH and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people,” and Mark reports Jesus as saying, “Daughter, thy FAITH hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.” The prophet says in theQur’an, “Surely those who believe and do good, their Lord will guide them by their FAITH; there shall flow from beneath them rivers in gardens of bliss.” In theAnalects of Confucius, the master says, “Hold FAITHFULNESS and sincerity as first principles, and be moving continually to what is right. This is the way to exalt one’s virtue.” In theBhagavad-Gitawe find, “The FAITH of each is in accordance with one’s own nature….A person is known by the faith. One can become whatever one wants to be (if one constantly contemplates on the object of desire with FAITH).” And again, “The one who has FAITH, and is sincere, and has mastery over the senses, gains…knowledge. Having gained this, one at once attains the supreme peace. But the ignorant, who has no faith and is full of doubt…perishes. There is neither this world nor the world beyond nor happiness for the one who doubts.” Let us consider the power of FAITH as it was demonstrated by Mahatma Gandhi of India,6who exhorted his followers to “Be the change you want to see in the world.” In this man the world had one of the most astounding examples known to civilization of the possibilities of FAITH. Gandhi wielded more power than any other person living in his time, and, yet, he had none of the orthodox tools of power such as money, battleships, soldiers, and materials of warfare. Gandhi had no money, he had no home, he did not own a suit of clothes, but HE DID HAVE POWER. How did he come by that power? HE CREATED IT OUT OF HIS UNDERSTANDING OF THE PRINCIPLE OF FAITH AND THROUGH HIS ABILITY TO TRANSPLANT THAT FAITH INTO THE MINDS OF TWO HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE. Gandhi accomplished through the influence of FAITH that which the strongest military power on earth could not then—and never will—accomplish through soldiers and military equipment. He accomplished the astounding feat of INFLUENCING two hundred million minds to COALESCE AND MOVE IN UNISON, AS A SINGLE MIND. What other force on earth except FAITH could do as much? There will come a day when employees, as well as employers, will discover the possibilities of FAITH. That day is dawning. The whole world has had ample opportunity during the recent worldwide economic downturn to witness what the LACK OF FAITH will do to business. Surely, civilization has produced a sufficient number of intelligent human beings to make use of this great lesson which has been taught the world. During this time of difficulty, the world had evidence in abundance that widespread FEAR can paralyze the wheels of industry and business. Out of this experience will arise leaders in business and industry who will profit by the example which Gandhi set for the world, and they will apply to business the same tactics which he used in building the greatest following known in the history of the world. These leaders will come from the rank and file of the “unknown” who now labor in the steel plants, the coal mines, the factories, and in the small towns and cities of America. Business is due for a reform, make no mistake about this! The methods of the past, based upon economic combinations of FORCE and FEAR, will be supplanted by the better principles of FAITH and cooperation. People who labor will receive more than daily wages. They will share more and more in profits from the business, the same as those who supply the capital for business. But first they must GIVE MORE TO THEIR EMPLOYERS and stop bickering and bargaining by force, at the expense of the public.They must earn the right to profit-sharing! Moreover—and this is the most important thing of all—THEY WILL BE LED BY LEADERS WHO WILL UNDERSTAND AND APPLY THE PRINCIPLES EMPLOYED BY GANDHI. Only in this way can leaders get from their followers the spirit of FULL cooperation which constitutes power in its highest and most enduring form.7 This stupendous age in which we live and from which we are just emerging has taken the soul out of people. Its leaders have driven workers as though they were pieces of cold machinery; they were forced to do so by the employees who bargained, at the expense of all concerned, togetand not togive. The watchword of the future will be HUMAN HAPPINESS AND CONTENTMENT, and when this state of mind shall have been attained, the production will take care of itself more effectively than anything that has ever beenaccomplished where workers did not, and could not, mix FAITH and individual interest with their labor. Because of the need for faith and cooperation in operating business and industry, it is both interesting and profitable to analyze an event which provides an excellent understanding of the method by which industrialists and business people accumulate great fortunes—bygivingbefore they try toget. The event chosen for this illustration dates back to 1900, when the United States Steel Corporation was being formed. As you read the story, keep in mind these fundamental facts and you will understand how IDEAS have been converted into huge fortunes: First, the huge United States Steel Corporation was born in the mind of Charles M. Schwab in the form of an IDEA he created through his IMAGINATION! Second, he mixed FAITH with his IDEA. Third, he formulated a PLAN for the transformation of his IDEA into physical and financial reality. Fourth, he put his plan into action with his famous speech at the University Club. Fifth, he applied and followed through on his PLAN with PERSISTENCE and backed it with firm DECISION until it had been fully carried out. Sixth, he prepared the way for success by a BURNING DESIRE for success. If you are one of those who often wonder how great fortunes are accumulated, this story of the creation of the United States Steel Corporation will be enlightening. If you have any doubt that individuals can THINK AND GROW RICH, this story should dispel that doubt because you can plainly see in the story of U.S. Steel the application of a major portion ofThe 13 Steps to Riches8described in this book. This astounding description of the power of an IDEA was dramatically told by John Lowell in theNew York World-Telegram, with whose courtesy it is here reprinted. When, on the evening of December 12, 1900, some eighty of the nation’s financial nobility gathered in the banquet hall of the University Club on Fifth Avenue to do honor to a young man from out of the West, not half a dozen of the guests realized they were to witness the most significant episode in American industrial history. J. Edward Simmons and Charles Stewart Smith, their hearts full of gratitude for the lavish hospitality bestowed on them by Charles M. Schwab during a recent visit to Pittsburgh, had arranged the dinner to introduce the thirty-eight-year-old steel man to eastern banking society. But they didn’t expect him to stampede the convention. They warned him, in fact, that the bosoms within New York’s stuffed shirts would not be responsive to oratory, and that, if he didn’t want to bore the Stillmans and Harrimans and Vanderbilts, he had better limit himself to fifteen or twenty minutes of polite vaporings and let it go at that. Even John Pierpont Morgan,9sitting on the right hand of Schwab as became his imperial dignity, intended to grace the banquet table with his presence only briefly. And so far as the press and public were concerned, the whole affair was of so little moment that no mention of it found its way into print the next day. So the two hosts and their distinguished guests ate their way through the usual seven or eight courses. There was little conversation and what there was of it was restrained. Few of the bankers and brokers had met Schwab, whose career had flowered along the banks of the Monongahela, and none knew him well. But before the evening was over, they -- and with them Money Master Morgan -- were to be swept off their feet, and a billion-dollar baby, the United States Steel Corporation, was to be conceived. It is perhaps unfortunate, for the sake of history, that no record of Charlie Schwab’s speech at the dinner ever was made. He repeated some parts of it at a later date during a similar meeting of Chicago bankers. And still later, when the Government brought suit to dissolve the Steel Trust, he gave his own version, from the witness stand, of the remarks that stimulated Morgan into a frenzy of financial activity.10 It is probable, however, that it was a “homely” speech, somewhat ungrammatical (for the niceties of language never bothered Schwab), full of epigram and threaded with wit. But aside from that it had a galvanic force and effect upon the five billions of estimated capital that was represented by the diners. After it was over and the gathering was still under its spell, although Schwab had talked for ninety minutes, Morgan led the orator to a recessed window where, dangling their legs from the high, uncomfortable seat, they talked for an hour more. The magic of the Schwab personality had been turned on, full force, but what was more important and lasting was the full-fledged, clear-cut program he laid down for the aggrandizement of Steel. Many other men had tried to interest Morgan in slapping together a steel trust after the pattern of the biscuit, wire and hoop, sugar, rubber, whisky, oil or chewing gum combinations. John W. Gates, the gambler, had urged it, but Morgan distrusted him. The Moore boys, Bill and Jim, Chicago stockjobbers who had glued together a match trust and a cracker corporation, had urged it and failed. Elbert H. Gary, the sanctimonious country lawyer, wanted to foster it, but he wasn’t big enough to be impressive. Until Schwab’s eloquence took J. P. Morgan to the heights from which he could visualize the solid results of the most daring financial undertaking ever conceived, the project was regarded as a delirious dream of easy-money crackpots. The financial magnetism that began a generation ago to attract thousands of small and sometimes inefficientlymanaged companies into large and competition-crushing combinations, had become operative in the steel world through the devices of that jovial business pirate, John W. Gates. Gates already had formed the American Steel and Wire Company out of a chain of small concerns, and together with Morgan had created the Federal Steel Company. The National Tube and American Bridge companies were two more Morgan concerns, and the Moore Brothers had forsaken the match and cookie business to form the “American group”—Tin Plate, Steel Hoop, Sheet Steel—and the National Steel Company. But by the side of Andrew Carnegie’s gigantic vertical trust, a trust owned and operated by fifty-three partners, those other combinations were picayune. They might combine to their heart’s content but the whole lot of them couldn’t make a dent in the Carnegie organization, and Morgan knew it. The eccentric old Scot knew it, too. From the magnificent heights of Skibo*Castle he had viewed, first with amusement and then with resentment, the attempts of Morgan’s smaller companies to cut into his business. When the attempts became too bold, Carnegie’s temper was translated into anger and retaliation. He decided to duplicate every mill owned by his rivals. Hitherto, he hadn’t been interested in wire, pipe, hoops, or sheet. Instead, he was content to sell such companies the raw steel and let them work it into whatever shape they wanted. Now, with Schwab as his chief and able lieutenant, he planned to drive his enemies to the wall. So it was that in the speech of Charles M. Schwab, Morgan saw the answer to his problem of combination. A trust without Carnegie—giant of them all—would be no trust at all, a plum pudding, as one writer said, without the plums. *Skibo was a splendid castle Carnegie built for his family on Dornoch Firth in Scotland. Schwab’s speech on the night of December 12, 1900, undoubtedly carried the inference, though not the pledge, that the vast Carnegie enterprise could be brought under the Morgan tent. He talked of the world future for steel, of reorganization for efficiency, of specialization, of the scrapping of unsuccessful mills and concentration of effort on the flourishing properties, of economies in the ore traffic, of economies in overhead and administrative departments, of capturing foreign markets. More than that, he told the buccaneers among them wherein lay the errors of their customary piracy. Their purposes, he inferred, had been to create monopolies, raise prices, and pay themselves fat dividends out of privilege. Schwab condemned the system in his heartiest manner. The shortsightedness of such a policy, he told his hearers, lay in the fact that it restricted the market in an era when everything cried for expansion. By cheapening the cost of steel, he argued, an ever-expanding market would be created; more uses for steel would be devised, and a goodly portion of the world trade could be captured. Actually, though he did not know it, Schwab was an apostle of modern mass production. So the dinner at the University Club came to an end. Morgan went home, to think about Schwab’s rosy predictions. Schwab went back to Pittsburgh to run the steel business for “Wee Andra Carnegie,” while Gary and the rest went back to their stock tickers, to fiddle around in anticipation of the next move. It was not long coming. It took Morgan about one week to digest the feast of reason Schwab had placed before him. When he had assured himself that no financial indigestion was to result, he sent for Schwab—and found that young man rather coy. Mr. Carnegie, Schwab indicated, might not like it if he found his trusted company president had been flirting with the Emperor of Wall Street, the Street upon which Carnegie was resolved never to tread. Then it wassuggested by John W. Gates the go-between, that if Schwab “happened” to be in the Bellevue Hotel in Philadelphia, J. P. Morgan might also “happen” to be there. When Schwab arrived, however, Morgan was inconveniently ill at his New York home, and so, on the elder man’s pressing invitation, Schwab went to New York and presented himself at the door of the financier’s library. Now certain economic historians have professed the belief that from the beginning to the end of the drama, the stage was set by Andrew Carnegie that the dinner to Schwab, the famous speech, the Sunday night conference between Schwab and the Money King, were events arranged by the canny Scot. The truth is exactly the opposite. When Schwab was called in to consummate the deal, he didn’t even know whether “the little boss,” as Andrew was called, would so much as listen to an offer to sell, particularly to a group of men whom Andrew regarded as being endowed with something less than holiness. But Schwab did take into the conference with him, in his own handwriting, six sheets of copper-plate figures, representing to his mind the physical worth and the potential earning capacity of every steel company he regarded as an essential star in the new metal firmament. Four men pondered over these figures all night. The chief, of course, was Morgan, steadfast in his belief in the Divine Right of Money. With him was his aristocratic partner, Robert Bacon, a scholar and a gentleman. The third was John W. Gates, whom Morgan scorned as a gambler and used as a tool. The fourth was Schwab, who knew more about the processes of making and selling steel than any whole group of men then living. Throughout that conference, the Pittsburgher’s figures were never questioned. If he said a company was worth so much, then it was worth that much and no more. He was insistent, too, upon including in the combination only those concerns he nominated. He had conceived a corporation in which there would beno duplication, not even to satisfy the greed of friends who wanted to unload their companies upon the broad Morgan shoulders. Thus he left out, by design, a number of the larger concerns upon which the Walruses and Carpenters of Wall Street had cast hungry eyes. When dawn came, Morgan rose and straightened his back. Only one question remained. “Do you think you can persuade Andrew Carnegie to sell?” he asked. “I can try,” said Schwab. “If you can get him to sell, I will undertake the matter,” said Morgan. So far so good. But would Carnegie sell? How much would he demand? (Schwab thought about $320,000,000). What would he take payment in? Common or preferred stocks? Bonds? Cash? Nobody could raise a third of a billion dollars in cash. There was a golf game in January on the frost-cracking heath of the St. Andrews links in Westchester, with Andrew bundled up in sweaters against the cold, and Charlie talking volubly, as usual, to keep his spirits up. But no word of business was mentioned until the pair sat down in the cozy warmth of the Carnegie cottage hard by. Then, with the same persuasiveness that had hypnotized eighty millionaires at the University Club, Schwab poured out the glittering promises of retirement in comfort, of untold millions to satisfy the old man’s social caprices. Carnegie capitulated, wrote a figure on a slip of paper, handed it to Schwab and said, “All right, that’s what we’ll sell for.” The figure was approximately $400,000,000, and was reached by taking the $320,000,000 mentioned by Schwab as a basic figure, and adding to it $80,000,000 to represent the increased capital value over the previous two years. Later, on the deck of a trans-Atlantic liner, the Scotsman said ruefully to Morgan, “I wish I had asked you for $100,000,000 more.” “If you had asked for it, you’d have gotten it,” Morgan told him cheerfully.11 * * * * * * * * There was an uproar, of course. A British correspondent cabled that the foreign steel world was “appalled” by the gigantic combination. President Hadley, of Yale, declared that unless trusts were regulated the country might expect “an emperor in Washington within the next twenty-five years.” But that able stock manipulator, Keene, went at his work of shoving the new stock at the public so vigorously that all the excess water—estimated by some at nearly $600,000,000—was absorbed in a twinkling. So Carnegie had his millions, and the Morgan syndicate had $62,000,000 for all its “trouble,” and all the “boys,” from Gates to Gary, had their millions. * * * * * * * * The thirty-eight-year-old Schwab had his reward. He was made president of the new corporation and remained in control until 1930. The dramatic story of “Big Business” which you have just finished was included in this book because it is a perfect illustration of the method by whichDESIRE CAN BE TRANSMUTED INTO ITS PHYSICAL EQUIVALENT! I imagine some readers will question the statement that a mere intangible DESIRE can be converted into its physical equivalent. Doubtless some will say, “You cannot convert NOTHING into SOMETHING!” The answer is in the story of United States Steel. That giant organization was created in the mind of one man. The plan by which the organization was provided with the steel mills that gave it financial stability was created in the mind of the same man. His FAITH, his DESIRE, his IMAGINATION, his PERSISTENCE were the real ingredients that went into United States Steel. The steel mills and mechanical equipment acquired bythe corporation AFTER IT HAD BEEN BROUGHT INTO LEGAL EXISTENCE were incidental, but careful analysis will disclose the fact that the appraised value of the properties acquired by the corporation increased in value by an estimated SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS12by the mere transaction which consolidated them under one management. In other words, Charles M. Schwab’s IDEA, plus the FAITH with which he conveyed it to the minds of J. P. Morgan and the others, was marketed for a profit of approximately $600,000,000. Not an insignificant sum for a single IDEA! What happened to some of those who took their share of the millions of dollars of profit made by this transaction is a matter with which we are not now concerned. The important feature of the astounding achievement is that it serves as unquestionable evidence of the soundness of the philosophy described in this book—because this philosophy was the warp and the woof of the entire transaction. Moreover, the practicability of the philosophy has been established by the fact that the United States Steel Corporation prospered and became one of the richest and most powerful corporations in America, employing thousands of people, developing new uses for steel, and opening new markets—thus proving that the $600,000,000 in profit which the Schwab IDEA produced was earned. RICHES begin in the form of THOUGHT! The amount is limited only by the person in whose mind the THOUGHT is put into motion. FAITH removes limitations! Remember this when you are ready to bargain with Life for whatever it is that you ask as your price for having passed this way. Remember, also, that the man who created the United States Steel Corporation was practically unknown at the time. He was merely Andrew Carnegie’s “Man Friday” until he gave birth to his famous IDEA. After that he quickly rose to a position of power, fame, and riches. And he rose, like all great achievers, on the wings of FAITH, which can be created by a powerful force known as AUTO-SUGGESTION."

        "text": "The Medium for Influencing the Subconscious MindThe Third Step to Riches AUTOSUGGESTION is a term which applies to all suggestions and all self-administered stimuli which reach one’s mind through the five senses. Stated in another way, autosuggestion isself-suggestion. It is the agency of communication between that part of the mind where conscious thought takes place and that which serves as the seat of action for the subconscious mind. The dominating thoughts which onepermitsto remain in the conscious mind (whether these thoughts be negative or positive is immaterial) willreach and influencethe subconscious mind, through the Law of Autosuggestion. NO THOUGHT, whether it be negative or positive, CAN ENTER THE SUBCONSCIOUS MIND WITHOUT THE AID OF THE PRINCIPLE OF AUTOSUGGESTION, with the exception of those thoughts picked up as “flashes of insight or inspiration.” Stated differently, all sense impressions which are perceived through the five senses are captured and processed by theconsciousthinking mind and may be either passed on to thesubconsciousmind or rejected, at will. The conscious faculty serves, therefore, as an outer guard at the approach to the subconscious. Nature has so “wired” human beings that they have ABSOLUTE CONTROL over the material which reaches their subconsciousmind through the five senses, although this is not meant to be construed as a statement that individuals always EXERCISE this control. In the great majority of instances, they do NOT exercise it, which explains why so many people go through life in poverty. Recall what has been said about the subconscious mind resembling a fertile garden in which weeds will grow in abundance if the seeds of more desirable crops are not sown therein. Autosuggestion is the agency of control through which an individual may voluntarily feed his or her subconscious mind on thoughts of a creative nature, or, by neglect, permit thoughts of a destructive nature to find their way into this rich garden of the mind. You were instructed in the last of the six action steps described in Chapter 1 to read ALOUD twice daily the WRITTEN statement of your DESIRE FOR MONEY, and to SEE AND FEEL yourself ALREADY in possession of the money! By following these instructions, you communicate the object of your DESIRE directly to your SUBCONSCIOUS mind in a spirit of absolute FAITH. Through repetition of this procedure, you voluntarily create thought habits which are favorable to your efforts to transmute desire into its monetary equivalent. (This procedure is NOT restricted to monetary gain alone. It can be used to help you achieve WHATEVER IT IS that you DESIRE STRONGLY, so long as it does not violate the laws of God or the rights of others.) Go back to these six actions described in Chapter 1 and read them again very carefully before you proceed further. Then skip ahead for a moment and read very carefully the four instructions for the organization of your Master Mind Group which are described in Chapter 6 on Organized Planning. By comparing these two sets of instructions with those that will be stated in this chapter on autosuggestion, you will see that all of these instructions involve the application of the Law of Autosuggestion. Remember, therefore, when reading aloud the statement of your desire (through which you are endeavoring to develop a “money consciousness” or any other “success consciousness”) that the mere reading of the words is of NO CONSEQUENCE—UNLESS you mix emotion, or feeling, with your words. If you repeat a milliontimes the famous Emile Coue/1formula, “Day by day, in every way, I am getting better and better,” without mixing emotion and FAITH with your words, you will experience no desirable results. Your subconscious mind recognizes and acts ONLY upon thoughts which have been well-mixed with emotion or feeling. This is a fact of such importance as to warrant repetition in practically every chapter of this book because the lack of understanding of this truth is the main reason why the majority of people who try to apply the Law of Autosuggestion get no desirable results. Plain, unemotional words do not influence the subconscious mind. You will get no appreciable results until you learn to reach your subconscious mind with thoughts or spoken words which have beenwell emotionalizedwith BELIEF. Do not become discouraged if you cannot control and direct your emotions the first time you try to do so. Remember, there is no such possibility as SOMETHING FOR NOTHING. The ability to reach and influence your subconscious mind has its price, and you MUST PAY THAT PRICE. You cannot cheat, even if you desire to do so. The price of ability to influence your subconscious mind is everlasting PERSISTENCE in applying the principles described here. You cannot develop the desired ability for a lower price. You, and YOU ALONE, must decide whether or not the reward for which you are striving (money consciousness) is worth the price you must pay for it in effort. Wisdom and cleverness alone will not attract and retain money except in a few very rare instances where the law of averages favors the attraction of money through such means. However, the method of attracting money described here doesnotdepend upon the law of averages. Moreover, the method plays no favorites. It will work for one person as effectively as it will for another. Where failure is experienced, it is the individual,not the method, which has failed. If you try and fail, make another effort, and still another, until you succeed. Your ability to use the Law of Autosuggestion will depend very largely upon your capacity to CONCENTRATE upon a givenDESIRE until that desire becomes a BURNING OBSESSION. When you begin to carry out the instructions in connection with the six action steps described in Chapter 1, it will be necessary for you to make use of the principle of CONCENTRATION. Let us here offer suggestions for the effective use of concentration. When you begin to carry out the first of the six actions (which instructs you to “fix in your own mind the EXACT amount of money you desire”), hold your thoughts on that amount of money by CONCENTRATION, or fixation of attention, with your eyes closed, until you can ACTUALLY SEE the physical appearance of the money. Do this at least once each day. As you go through these exercises, follow the instructions given in Chapter 2 on FAITH and see yourself actually IN POSSESSION OF THE MONEY! Here is a most significant fact—the subconscious mind takes any orders given it in a spirit of absolute FAITH, and acts upon those orders, although the orders often have to be presentedover and over again, through repetition, before they are interpreted by the subconscious mind. Consider the possibility of playing a perfectly legitimate trick on your subconscious mind by making it believe,because you believe it, that you must have the amount of money you are visualizing, that this money is already awaiting your claim, that the subconscious mind MUST hand over to you practical plans for acquiring the money which is yours. Hand over the thought suggested in the preceding paragraph to your IMAGINATION and see what your imagination can, or will do, to create practical plans for the accumulation of money through transmutation of your desire. DO NOT WAIT for a definite plan through which you intend to exchange services or merchandise in return for the money you are visualizing, but begin at once to see yourself in possession of the money, DEMANDING and EXPECTING meanwhile that your subconscious mind will hand over the plan or plans you need. Be on the alert for these plans, and when they appear, put them into ACTION IMMEDIATELY. When the plans appear, they will probably flash into your mind through the sixth sense, in the form of an inspiration. This inspiration may be considered a direct“telegram” or “message” from Infinite Intelligence. Treat it with respect, and act upon it as soon as you receive it. Failure to do this will be FATAL to your success. In the fourth of the six action steps you were instructed to “Create a definite plan for carrying out your desire, and begin at once to put this plan into action.” You should follow this instruction in the manner described in the preceding paragraph. Do not trust to your reason when creating your plan for accumulating money through the transmutation of desire. Your reason is faulty. Moreover, your reasoning faculty may be lazy, and if you depend entirely upon it to serve you, it may disappoint you. When visualizing (with closed eyes) the money you intend to accumulate,see yourself rendering the service or delivering the merchandise you intend to give in return for this money. This is important!2 The fact that you are reading this book is an indication that you earnestly seek knowledge. It is also an indication that you are a student of this subject. If you are only a student, there is a chance you may learn much that you did not know, but you will learn only by assuming an attitude of humility. If you choose to follow some of the instructions, but neglect or refuse to follow others—you will fail!To get satisfactory results, you must follow ALL instructions in a spirit of FAITH. The instructions given in connection with the six action steps in Chapter 1 will now be summarized and blended with the principles covered by this chapter. If your DEFINITE CHIEF AIM involves money and the attainment of wealth: First.Go into some quiet spot (preferably in bed at night) where you will not be disturbed or interrupted, close your eyes, and repeat aloud (so you may hear your own words) the written statement of the amount of money you intend to accumulate, the time limit for its accumulation, and a description of the service or merchandise you intend to give in return for the money. As you carry out these instructions, SEE YOURSELF ALREADY IN POSSESSION OF THE MONEY. For example, suppose that you intend to accumulate $500,000 by the first of January, five years hence, that you intend to give personal services in return for the money in the capacity of a sales representative. Your written statement of your purpose should be similar to the following: “By the first day of January, [here state the year], I will have in my possession $500,000, which will come to me in various amounts from time to time during the interim. “In return for this money I will give the most efficient service of which I am capable, rendering the fullest possible quantity, and the best possible quality of service in the capacity of selling…. (describe the service or merchandise you intend to sell). “I believe that I will have this money in my possession. My faith is so strong that I can now see this money before my eyes. I can touch it with my hands. It is now awaiting transfer to me at the time and in the proportion that I deliver the service I intend to render in return for it. I am awaiting a plan by which to accumulate this money, and I will follow that plan when it is received.” Second. Repeat this program night and morning until you can clearly visualize (in your imagination) the money you intend to accumulate. Third. Place a written copy of your statement where you can see it night and morning, and read it just before retiring and upon arising until it has been memorized.3 Remember as you carry out these instructions that you are applying the Law of Autosuggestion for the purpose of giving orders to your subconscious mind. Remember that these instructions apply particularly to the desire for money, but also to any other object you desire or goal you seek. Remember also that your subconsciousmind will act ONLY upon instructions which are emotionalized and handed over to it with feeling. FAITH is the strongest and most productive of the emotions. Follow the instructions given in Chapter 2. These instructions may at first seem abstract. Do not let this disturb you. Follow the instructions no matter how abstract or impractical they may at first appear to be. The time will soon come, if you do as you have been instructed,in spirit as well as in fact, when a whole new universe of power will unfold to you. Skepticism, in connection with ALL new ideas, is characteristic of all human beings. But if you follow the instructions outlined, your skepticism will soon be replaced by belief, and this in turn will soon become crystallized into ABSOLUTE FAITH. Then you will have arrived at the point where you may truly say, “I am the Master of my Fate, I am the Captain of my Soul!” Many philosophers have made the statement that each person is the master of his or her own earthly destiny, but most of them have failed to say why this is so. The reason that we may be the master of our own earthly status, and especially our financial status, is thoroughly explained in this chapter. We may become the master of ourselves, and of our environment, because we have the POWER TO INFLUENCE OUR OWN SUBCONSCIOUS MIND, and through it, to gain the cooperation of Infinite Intelligence. The chapter you are now reading represents the keystone in the arch ofThe Think and Grow Rich Philosophy. The instructions contained in this chapter must be understood and APPLIED WITH PERSISTENCE if you are to succeed in transmuting desire into money or any other result you seek. The actual performance of transmuting DESIRE into money involves the use of autosuggestion as an agency by which you may reach and influence the subconscious mind. The other principles are simply tools with which to apply autosuggestion. Keep this thought in mind, and you will at all times be conscious of the important part that the Law of Autosuggestion is to play in your efforts to accumulate money through the methods described in this book. Carry out these instructions as though you were a small child. Inject into your efforts something of the FAITH of a child. I have been most careful to see that no impractical instructions are included because of my sincere desire to be helpful. After you have read the entire book, come back to this chapter and follow in spirit, and in action, this instruction: READ THIS ENTIRE CHAPTER ALOUD ONCE EVERY NIGHT UNTIL YOU BECOME THOROUGHLY CONVINCED THAT THE PRINCIPLE OF AUTOSUGGESTION IS SOUND, THAT IT WILL ACCOMPLISH FOR YOU ALL THAT HAS BEEN CLAIMED FOR IT. AS YOU READ,UNDERSCORE WITH A PENCILEVERY SENTENCE WHICH IMPRESSES YOU FAVORABLY. Follow the foregoing instructions to the letter and it will open the way for a complete understanding and mastery of all the principles of success, including the one to which we now turn—SPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE,The Fourth Step to Riches. I BELIEVE THAT CLOSE ASSOCIATION WITH ONE WHO REFUSES TO COMPROMISE WITH CIRCUMSTANCES HE OR SHE DOES NOT LIKE IS AN ASSET THAT CAN NEVER BE MEASURED IN TERMS OF MONEY."
